<p>The Birthday Party</p>
<p>This week I stayed with the Birthday Party theme, I choose this because I was able to elaborate more on the details, such as the weather. </p>
<p>This week was a little more challenging because of the flowchart being added, even though all the examples were there some of the added terms were a bit harder to follow.</p>
